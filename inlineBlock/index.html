        <p class="para"> This is a paragraph. This element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.A <b> block-level </b>  element always starts on a new line, and the browse automatically    add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
             A <b> block-level </b> element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Two commonly used block elements are:  &lt;P&gt and &lt;div&gt. </p>

        <div id="div">
            Div  <b> &lt;div&gt; </b> is also a <b>block </b> level element.In HTML and CSS, block elements are elements that typically start on a new line and take up the full width available, pushing subsequent elements onto the next line. These elements are often used for larger structures like paragraphs, headings, lists, divs, and so on. They can contain other block elements as well as inline elements.
        </div>
